			<div class=content><h2>Space Haptics</h2>
			
			<p><strong>A haptics based computer game set in space.</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><h3>What is it?</h3></p>
			<p>Space Haptics is a computer game that is controller with the <a href="http://www.novint.com/index.php/novintfalcon">Novint Falcon</a> haptic device. The game Space Haptics was developed in the <a href="http://www.chai3d.org/">Chai 3D</a> engine using the C++ programming language. The aim of the game is to steer a spaceship in a 3D space and to collect coins in order to gain points using the haptic device. The game also involves asteroids that make the user lose points when colliding with them. Each collision with an object provides haptic feedback through the haptic device. The acceleration and deceleration forces are also felt through the haptic device by either increaseing or decreasing the resistance respectively.</p>

				<p>The application starts and a timer ticks down from 60 s to 0. For each collision points are either added (coin) or deducted (asteroid).</p>

			<div class="content_box">

				<p>The speed of the spaceship is determined by the position of the haptic device. The farther away the device is the faster the spaceship will travel through space, also making it have more objects on screen simultaneously.</p>

				<p>When the time is up, the user can no longer get points. Watch out, hitting more asteroids than coins might give you a negative score!</p>
