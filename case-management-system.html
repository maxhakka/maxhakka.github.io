							<h1>A Case Management System<span>.</span></h1>
							<div class="w3-section w3-bottombar bottombar"></div>
							<p class="ingress">An improved Case Management System with new features and functionality for a company owned by the City of Stockholm.
								The focus of this project was mergin two existing systems into one responsive website, with exactly the same functionality
								and usability both on desktop and mobile.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="w3-container">
							<h2>Background and Problem</h2>
							<p>
								The existing case management system that was used at the company was antiquited and lacked core features. 
								Another problem was separate systems with different funcitonality for mobile and desktop, resulting in
								employees having to document things on paper while out in the field or to contact their collegues in the office
								who had access to the desktop version of the cased management system.
							</p>
							<p>
								The aim of the project was thus to reduce the amound of manual administration for the company staff as well as 
								modernising and simplifying the interface of the system. As the vast majority of the users accessed the system 
								via their phones, a responsive and mobile first design was of particular importance in this project.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="w3-container">
							<h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
							<p>
								At the start of the project, a number of employees were interviewed in order to establish pain points as well as to 
								map out the types of users for the system. A number of workshops were also conducted together with the company, where 
								many types of users were represented.
							</p>

							<div class="w3-col m12">
								<img class="img-fullwidth" src="img/workshop.jpg" alt="post-it notes on a whiteboard">
								<p class="img-text">A workshop was conducted together with the company, involving several different types of end users.</p>
							</div>

							<p>
								The workshops resulted in a number epics and of user stories as well the information architechure of the new site. A dasboard
								with an overview of the cases was the starting point, which would then link to a list of all the cases as well as facilites.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="w3-container">
							<h2>Ideation and Design</h2>
							<p>
								Based on the user stories nad the information architechure generated during the workshops, a number of low-fi wireframes were made. These 
								wireframes were consequently tested on users using the think aloud method. Based on the test results, a number of adjustments were made and
								high fidelity designs created. The designs were based on grappic profile of the company.
							</p>

							<div class="w3-col m6">
								<img class="img-height-restricted" src="img/low-fi-spark.png" alt="a low fidelity design of a dashboard">
								<p class="w3-container img-text">The first low fidelity design of the dasboard made in Balsamiq.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="w3-col m6">
								<img class="img-height-restricted" src="img/high-fi-spark.png" alt="a high fidelity design of a dashboard">
								<p class="w3-container img-text">A high fidelity version of the same design made in Sketch App.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="w3-col m12">
								<img class="img-fullwidth" src="img/spark-desktop.jpg" alt="a desktop verion of a dashboard">
								<p class="img-text">The desktop version of the dasboard.</p>
							</div>
							<p>
								A mobile first approach was used when creating the designs, as the vast majority of the users are on mobile. This means focusing on creating the 
								mobile designs first and then adapting them to desktops. This ensures that the amount of information is adapted to smaller screens first. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The high fidelity designs were then user tested as well and final adjustments were made based on the feedback from the user tests.
